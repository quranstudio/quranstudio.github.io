QuranStudio is an open space for artistic exploration of Quran
---------------------------------------------------------------

1. There is no limit to Quranic exploration. You are encouraged to suggest and be a part of these efforts to deep dive Quranic studies, unravel timeless treasures through data mining, text analysis, visualiszations and much more.   
2. We have two main initiatives **QuranStudio** and **QuranLab**. 
3. However, we would like to keep ideas for incubation in **QuranLab** (https://github.com/quranstudio) and once ideas reach beta stage (as decided by community) then they be moved to the **QuranStudio** (https://github.com/quranstudio).
